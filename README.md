# # ProjectHeart - Heart Disease Prediction

This project uses health data to predict the presence of heart disease using machine learning models.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a patient is likely to have heart disease based on various health metrics such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other factors.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed. You can follow these steps to set up the project environment:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/CesarRonai/ProjectHeart.git
    cd ProjectHeart
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook notebooks/ProjectHeart.ipynb
    ```

## Usage

You can use this project to:

- Explore and visualize heart disease data.
- Train machine learning models on health-related datasets.
- Predict whether a patient has heart disease using a trained model.

### Example Usage

After cloning the repository and installing the dependencies, open the Jupyter Notebook and run the cells step by step. It will guide you through:

- Data loading and exploration
- Visualizing key features
- Training and evaluating a machine learning model

Alternatively, you can run the Python script for training the model:

```bash
python src/train_model.py
